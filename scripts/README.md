# Scritps

Scripts to create common and diff files for dotfiles:

- `diff_files`: shows the resulting diff of a dotfile for all the themes.
- `remove_files`: removes all the files with the same name as the given one. Ignores the common directory.
- `substitute`: uses `envsubst` and `jq` to substitute the values of a template for the values given on a json file.

### Centralized Installing

Try to modularize installation:

- [ ] Generic dependencies
- [ ] Applications

### Uniform Folder Structure

Make sure all folder follow the same structure as the common folder.

- [ ] Default

### Templates for common modules

There are some modules like zathura, polybar, etc. that are not present on every theme but are quite common. There should be a way to define common configurations that could optionally be added to themes based on some configuration file (like the `variables.json` file).
